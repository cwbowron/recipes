# Grilled Bratwurst with Beer, Mustard, and Sauerkraut

## Ingredients
* 2 cups lager-style beer
* 3 tablespoons whole grain mustard
* 1 (1 pound) package sauerkraut, with juices 6 sprigs thyme (optional)
* 2 pounds bratwurst sausages
* Buns and mustard for serving

## Procedures

1. Combine beer, mustard, and sauerkraut in a 10-inch square disposable aluminum pan. Alternatively, construct a tray out of a double layer of heavy duty aluminum foil, 10 inches square, with sides about 2 inches high. Stir until mustard is broken up and mixture is homogenous. Add thyme sprigs. Nestle sausages into sauerkraut.

2. Place tray on hot side of grill and cook until simmering, about 4 minutes. Slide to cooler side of grill. Cover grill with vents over the sausages. Cook with all vents open until sausages register 140° to 145°F on an instant read thermometer, about 20 minutes, turning once in the middle.

3. Remove lid. Using tongs, remove sausages from sauerkraut and place directly on cooking grates over hot side of grill. Cook, turning occasionally, until well browned and crisp, about 3 minutes total. Return to sauerkraut. Toast buns over hot side of grill if desired. Serve sausages with buns, mustard, and sauerkraut
